Effective decision making in such systems requires an understanding of the relationship between stocks and the flows that alter them. However, highly educated people are often unable to infer the behavior of simple stock–flow systems. In a series of experiments we demonstrate that poor understanding of accumulation, termed stock–flow failure, is a fundamental reasoning error. Persistent poor performance is not attributable to an inability to interpret graphs, lack of contextual knowledge, motivation, or cognitive capacity. Rather, stock–flow failure is a robust phenomenon that appears to be rooted in failure to appreciate the most basic principles of accumulation, leading to the use of inappropriate heuristics. We show that many people, including highly educated individuals with strong technical training, use what we term the “correlation heuristic”, erroneously assuming that the behavior of a stock matches the pattern of its flows. We discuss the origins of stock–flow failure and implications for management and education.},	keywords={Dynamic Decision Making; Cognitive Capacity; Accumulation; Stocks And Flows; System Dynamics},	isbn={07495978},	url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2008.03.003}}@article{RefWorks:11,	author={E.

This failure to represent the whole system is clearly problematic, because natural and socio-economic systems exhibit complex, nonlinear behaviour, and each certainly affects the other. We therefore offer an alternative approach, based on explicit modelling of the feedbacks within and between components of the system. The system dynamics simulation methodology used here facilitates representation of feedback processes, time delays, and nonlinearities, and encourages an understanding of the interconnections within a system that fundamentally determine its behaviour. As a working example of the system dynamics approach, our paper describes a simple climate-carbon cycle-water cycle-population closed-loop model. A set of three experiments compare a "business-as-usual" case with model modifications, including exogenous technology change, and endogenous equation and parameter changes. Analysis of the experimental results demonstrates model sensitivities and shortcomings: exponential growth patterns may indicate the necessity for additional model sectors and feedbacks, and sensitive relationships suggest the need for further study. Future work will improve the representation of socio-economic sectors of the model.},	isbn={1-4244-0218-2},	url={http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057296&contentType=Conference+Publications}}@article{RefWorks:6,	author={Evan G.

While these models are quite varied in scope, most share a common core of economic optimization and equilibrium assumptions. By contrast, system dynamics models of energv-economy interactions focus on disequilibrium dynamics, with behavioral decision rules and explicit stocks and flows of capital, labor, resources and money. This article tests climate policies using a system dynamics model that includes many features missing from economic models. Among these are endogenous technological change and boundedly rational decision making, Energy requirements are embodied in capital, and energy production capacity depends on explicit capital stocks. The search for optimal policies is decoupled from other decisions, and uses criteria that are fair across generations. Earlier experiments with the model, briefly reported here, indicate that these features greatly alter policy outcomes. The model is used to test a family of emissions permit and tax policies like the Kyoto Protocol under a range of assumptions. Uncertainty is included in the analysis through Monte Carlo simulation. Results suggest that nearly all police options are a net benefit, and that the landscape for policy choice is more forgiving than generally supposed. However, implementation remains a critical issue, and the viability of tradeable permits is questionable. Carbon tax policies are found to outperform fixed emissions permits in nearly all circumstances. The model used in this article is available at http://www.sd3.info.

Mental models of industry participants are important, both as the holders of the best system information and as the critical actors in any policy solution. Experts from manufacturing, installation, development, policy, and advocacy sectors were interviewed. The knowledge they conveyed was expressed as a set system dynamics models; these models were characterized, compared, and combined in order to answer the following research questions: What are the mental models of participants? How widely are mental models shared among participants? What is the combined model of the system? How accurate are these models? Given these models, what policies would lead to success? The system described by informants is revealed as one of distributed and embedded agency--actors have the ability to take meaningful action, but that action and its effects are limited by the complexity of the system and by the actions of other actors. Both the growth of the industry and constraints on the growth occur through dynamic processes, many however outside local control. Mental models are shared in clusters of informants, with some differences between these groupings. Informants vary on the level of aggregation needed to express their descriptions and on the most important dynamic force. However, many processes are commonly perceived across informants, they perceive the same system trajectories, and the behavior of the simulation models constructed from their mental models was similar. A combined model was constructed which included a full range of potential feedback loops within an abstracted version of the described system. Testing for policy using the combined model reveals that the structures necessary for growth are present, as expected. Under several reasonable conditions, growth can be halted before reaching its potential: if reinforcing feedback processes saturate; if industry capacity grows too slowly; or if goals are too low or if they erode. Coordinated actions--multiple small interventions--are more effective than isolated large actions as market growth policy.},	keywords={Policy making; Urban planning; Renewable resources; Political science; Energy industry},	isbn={9781109900934},	url={http://search.proquest.com/docview/304816361/fulltextPDF/embedded/MYJQ72EIJU4K4JKG?source=fedsrch; http://search.proquest.com/docview/304816361/abstract/embedded/MYJQ72EIJU4K4JKG?source=fedsrch}}@article{RefWorks:13,	author={P.

The paper discusses pollution taxes, emission trading permits and green certificates applied to reduce the CO 2 -emissions in the electricity sector. It then investigates how the different mechanisms behind these three instruments can possibly be combined. The proposed approach is to introduce the concept of zero-emission certificates (ZEC). ZEC are confirming actual emission reductions achieved by electricity producers as compared to a well-defined baseline. Producers can trade ZEC on a market to achieve least-cost efficiency in their reduction efforts. Distributors can themselves produce an additional contribution to emission-reductions by decreasing the final demand, i.e., by producing zero-emission MWh. In this way the electricity market is approached from both the supply and the demand sides. The paper uses system dynamics to validate the approach. It shows why it is in the interest of all operators to make the largest possible reduction efforts as long as they are compatible with economic efficiency.},	keywords={System Dynamics; Climate Change; Taxes; Trading Permits; Green Certificates; Zero-emission Certificates},	isbn={03772217},	url={http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0377-2217(03)00160-7}}@article{RefWorks:9,	author={Margarita Mediavilla},	year={2013},	title={The transition towards renewable energies: Physical limits and temporal conditions},	journal={Energy Policy, 2013, Vol.52, pp.297-311},	volume={52},	pages={297-311},	note={ID: NEWPC; ID: Primo Central Index (Ex Libris)},	abstract={The perspectives of the depletion of fossil energy resources, together with the consequences of climate change, have provoked the development of numerous national and pluri-national energy policies. However, there have been few overall studies on the evolution of these resources. This paper uses a dynamic model to study the exhaustion patterns of world fossil and nuclear fuels and their possible replacement by renewable energy sources. The results show that peak oil will be the first restriction and it will not be easily overcome. Electric vehicles can produce some interesting savings, but they are insufficient to avoid the decline in oil. Biofuels are even more limited, due to the enormous extensions of fertile land they require and their low productivity. This shows that overcoming the decline in oil will need much more ambitious policies than the mere substitution of technology. If the “oil–economy” relationship does not change substantially, world economic growth may be seriously limited or even negative.

The results show that at present nearly 0.85 million megawatt hours per year (MWh/y) energy is required for conveyance of water in distribution laterals of the Valley from Lake Mead resulting in approximately 0.53 million metric tons of CO2 emissions per year.

However, the strong scientific consensus on the detection, attribution, and risks of climate change stands in stark contrast to widespread confusion, complacency and denial among policymakers and the public. Risk communication is now a major bottleneck preventing science from playing an appropriate role in climate policy. Here I argue that the ability of the IPCC to fulfill its mission can be enhanced through better understanding of the mental models of the audiences it seeks to reach, then altering the presentation and communication of results accordingly. Few policymakers are trained in science, and public understanding of basic facts about climate change is poor. But the problem is deeper. Our mental models lead to persistent errors and biases in complex dynamic systems like the climate and economy. Where the consequences of our actions spill out across space and time, our mental models have narrow boundaries and focus on the short term. Where the dynamics of complex systems are conditioned by multiple feedbacks, time delays, accumulations and nonlinearities, we have difficulty recognizing and understanding feedback processes, underestimate time delays, and do not understand basic principles of accumulation or how nonlinearities can create regime shifts. These problems arise not only among laypeople but also among highly educated elites with significant training in science. They arise not only in complex systems like the climate but also in familiar contexts such as filling a bathtub. Therefore they cannot be remedied merely by providing more information about the climate, but require different modes of communication, including experiential learning environments such as interactive simulations.},	keywords={Training; Numerical simulations; Public policy and climate; Risk assessment; Climate change; Economics; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Simulation; Communications; Climatic changes; Environmental policy; Climate; Climate models},	isbn={0165-0009},	url={http://search.proquest.com/docview/913807841/abstract/embedded/MYJQ72EIJU4K4JKG?source=fedsrch}}@article{RefWorks:19,	author={John D.

Surveys show most Americans believe climate change poses serious risks but also that reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions sufficient to stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations can be deferred until there is greater evidence that climate change is harmful. US policymakers likewise argue it is prudent to wait and see whether climate change will cause substantial economic harm before undertaking policies to reduce emissions. Such wait-and-see policies erroneously presume climate change can be reversed quickly should harm become evident, underestimating substantial delays in the climate's response to anthropogenic forcing. We report experiments with highly educated adults - graduate students at MIT - showing widespread misunderstanding of the fundamental stock and flow relationships, including mass balance principles, that lead to long response delays. GHG emissions are now about twice the rate of GHG removal from the atmosphere. GHG concentrations will therefore continue to rise even if emissions fall, stabilizing only when emissions equal removal. In contrast, most subjects believe atmospheric GHG concentrations can be stabilized while emissions into the atmosphere continuously exceed the removal of GHGs from it. These beliefs - analogous to arguing a bathtub filled faster than it drains will never overflow - support wait-and-see policies but violate conservation of matter. Low public support for mitigation policies may arise from misconceptions of climate dynamics rather than high discount rates or uncertainty about the impact of climate change.

But many advocate delaying action until there is more evidence that warming is harmful. The stock and flow structure of the climate, however, means “wait and see” policies guarantee further warming. Atmospheric CO concentration is now higher than any time in the last 420,000 years, and growing faster than any time in the past 20,000 years. The high concentration of CO and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) generates significant radiative forcing that contributes to warming. To reduce radiative forcing and the human contribution to warming, GHG concentrations must fall. To reduce GHG concentrations, emissions must fall below the rate at which GHGs are removed from the atmosphere. Anthropogenic CO emissions are now roughly double the removal rate, and the removal rate is projected to fall as natural carbon sinks saturate. Emissions must therefore fall by more than half even to stabilize CO at present record levels. Such reductions greatly exceed the Kyoto targets, while the Bush administration's Clear Skies Initiative calls for continued emissions growth. Does the public understand these physical facts? We report experiments assessing people's intuitive understanding of climate change. We presented highly educated graduate students with descriptions of greenhouse warming drawn from the IPCC's nontechnical reports. Subjects were then asked to identify the likely response to various scenarios for CO emissions or concentrations. The tasks require no mathematics, only an understanding of stocks and flows and basic facts about climate change. Overall performance was poor. Subjects often select trajectories that violate conservation of matter. Many believe temperature responds immediately to changes in CO emissions or concentrations. Still more believe that stabilizing emissions near current rates would stabilize the climate, when in fact emissions would continue to exceed removal, increasing GHG concentrations and radiative forcing. Such beliefs support “wait and see” policies, but violate basic laws of physics. We discuss implications for education and public policy.

However, the N sub(2)O GWP does not approximate well the historical temperature with any time horizon. We introduce a new exchange metric, TEMperature Proxy index (TEMP), that is defined so that it provides a best fit to the temperature projection of a given period. By comparing GWPs and TEMPs, we find that the inability of the N sub(2)O GWP to reproduce the historical temperature is caused by the GWP calculation methodology in IPCC using simplifying assumptions for the background system dynamics and uncertain parameter estimations. Furthermore, our TEMP calculations demonstrate that indices have to be progressively updated upon the acquisition of new measurements and/or the advancement of our understanding of Earth system processes.},	keywords={Climate; Climatic changes; Methane in the atmosphere; Greenhouse effect; Carbon dioxide; Atmospheric chemistry and climate; Methane; Atmospheric chemistry models; Global warming; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon cycle; International agreements; Historical account; Temperature; Kyoto Protocol; Emissions; Atmospheric pollution models; Carbon dioxide emissions},	isbn={0165-0009},	url={http://search.proquest.com/docview/1436948506/abstract/embedded/MYJQ72EIJU4K4JKG?source=fedsrch}}
