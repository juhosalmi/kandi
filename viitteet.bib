More than 20 climate-economy models have been developed to address different policy questions. While these integrated models are quite varied, most share some common assumptions and features. They typically employ a nested structure of neoclassical production functions to represent the energy-economy system. Technological potential is represented by elasticities of substitution, exogenous rates of technological improvement, and backstop energy prices. Factor allocation is myopically or intertemporally optimal. The impact of a carbon tax on the energy system at a given time can often be reduced to a simple tradeoff between abatement costs and emissions (though capital stock rigidities complicate the short- run picture in some models). The major endogenous dynamics of these models involve capital accumulation, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, and the temperature of the atmosphere and ocean system. These models draw heavily on the energy-economy models of the 70s and 80s, which were motivated by energy security issues and explored the potential impacts of increasing energy prices on economic growth. System dynamics models of that period shared the same motivation, but sought alternatives to the assumptions of optimization and equilibrium. They focused instead on disequilibrium dynamics and feedback complexity, with behavioral decision rules and explicit stocks and flows of capital, labor, and money. This research builds on earlier system dynamics models of energy economy interactions, creating a model that tests the implications of a number of feedback processes that have not been explored in the climate change context. Among these are endogenous technological change and boundedly rational decision making, with perception delays and biases. Energy requirements are embodied in capital, and energy production capacity depends on explicit capital stocks. The search for optimal The principal purpose of the model is to identify the structural features that have the greatest implications for policy, and thus are worthy of further pursuit. Experiments with the model indicate that depletion of oil and gas resources has critical interactions with climate policy. The inclusion of learning-by-doing and other path-dependent mechanisms suggests that abatement efforts will be more effective and should be more stringent than models with exogenous technology forecasts indicate. Inclusion of delays and biases from structural and behavioral features of the energy system creates higher long-run emissions reduction potential but imposes substantial constraints that prevent rapid reductions. Fair discounting and consideration of intangible damages substantially raise the indicated abatement effort. In both deterministic and uncertain cases, near-term inaction is a poor policy.},author = {Fiddaman, Thomas S},file = {:C$\backslash$:/Users/jtsalmi.AALTO/AppData/Local/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Fiddaman - 1997 - Feedback Complexity in Integrated Climate-Economy Models by.pdf:pdf},pages = {360},school = {Massachusetts Institute of Technology},title = {{Feedback Complexity in Integrated Climate-Economy Models by}},year = {1997}}@misc{Sterman2010,author = {Sterman, John D.},publisher = {Climate Interactive},title = {{John Sterman on C-ROADS Science and Confidence Building}},url = {http://vimeo.com/8596016},year = {2010}}@misc{AmericanInstituteofPhysicsSimple,author = {{American Institute of Physics}},title = {{The Discovery of Global Warming: Simple Models of Climate Change}},url = {http://www.aip.org/history/climate/simple.htm},urldate = {2013-12-06}}@article{ElizabethR.SawinAndrewP.JonesTomFiddamanLoriS.SiegelDianaWrightTravisFranckAndreasBarkmanTomCummingsFelicitasvonPeterJacquelineMcGladeRobertW.Corell2009,abstract = {We report the creation and initial use of the Climate-Rapid Overview And Decision Support Simulator (C- ROADS) (1), a simple, fast, user-friendly simulation of climate change that conforms with accepted climate science while allowing decision makers to discover through interactive exploration the range of greenhouse gas emissions trajectories sufficient to achieve widely accepted goals for climate stabilization – such as stabilizing CO2 levels at or below 350–450 parts per million (ppm) or limiting temperature increase to no more than 2° Centigrade over pre-industrial temperatures.

This failure to represent the whole system is clearly problematic, because natural and socio-economic systems exhibit complex, nonlinear behaviour, and each certainly affects the other. We therefore offer an alternative approach, based on explicit modelling of the feedbacks within and between components of the system. The system dynamics simulation methodology used here facilitates representation of feedback processes, time delays, and nonlinearities, and encourages an understanding of the interconnections within a system that fundamentally determine its behaviour. As a working example of the system dynamics approach, our paper describes a simple climate-carbon cycle-water cycle-population closed-loop model. A set of three experiments compare a "business-as-usual" case with model modifications, including exogenous technology change, and endogenous equation and parameter changes. Analysis of the experimental results demonstrates model sensitivities and shortcomings: exponential growth patterns may indicate the necessity for additional model sectors and feedbacks, and sensitive relationships suggest the need for further study.

By contrast, system dynamics models of energy–economy interactions focus on disequilibrium dynamics, with behavioral decision rules and explicit stocks and flows of capital, labor, resources and money. This article tests climate policies using a system dynamics model that includes many features missing from economic models. Among these are endogenous technological change and boundedly rational decision making. Energy requirements are embodied in capital, and energy production capacity depends on explicit capital stocks. The search for optimal policies is decoupled from other decisions, and uses criteria that are fair across generations. Earlier experiments with the model, briefly reported here, indicate that these features greatly alter policy outcomes. The model is used to test a family of emissions permit and tax policies like the Kyoto Protocol under a range of assumptions. Uncertainty is included in the analysis through Monte Carlo simulation. Results suggest that nearly all policy options are a net benefit, and that the landscape for policy choice is more forgiving than generally supposed.
