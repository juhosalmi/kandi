While these models are quite varied in scope, most share a common core of economic optimization and equilibrium assumptions. By contrast, system dynamics models of energy–economy interactions focus on disequilibrium dynamics, with behavioral decision rules and explicit stocks and flows of capital, labor, resources and money. This article tests climate policies using a system dynamics model that includes many features missing from economic models. Among these are endogenous technological change and boundedly rational decision making. Energy requirements are embodied in capital, and energy production capacity depends on explicit capital stocks. The search for optimal policies is decoupled from other decisions, and uses criteria that are fair across generations. Earlier experiments with the model, briefly reported here, indicate that these features greatly alter policy outcomes. The model is used to test a family of emissions permit and tax policies like the Kyoto Protocol under a range of assumptions. Uncertainty is included in the analysis through Monte Carlo simulation. Results suggest that nearly all policy options are a net benefit, and that the landscape for policy choice is more forgiving than generally supposed. However, implementation remains a critical issue, and the viability of tradeable permits is questionable. Carbon tax policies are found to outperform fixed emissions permits in nearly all circumstances.

Forrester Award for Exploring policy options with a behavioral climate–economy model (Fiddaman, 2002). Here I attempt to step back from modeling particulars, to talk about the global policy context of climate change. In particular, it appears to me that a great deal of effort is misdirected toward policies that are unlikely to achieve significant mitigation of climate change. Redirecting that effort toward practical policies requires a shift in the regulatory paradigm of policymakers and the mental models of the public. System dynamics is well positioned to contribute some of the innovations needed to make that shift happen.},author = {Fiddaman, Thomas S},doi = {10.1002/sdr},file = {:C$\backslash$:/Users/jtsalmi/AppData/Local/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Fiddaman - 2007 - Dynamics of Climate Policy.pdf:pdf},journal = {System Dynamics Review},keywords = {Kyoto,carbon,climate,global warming,integrated assessment,permit,tax,technology},mendeley-groups = {Kandi,Kandi/Ilmasto},number = {1},pages = {21--34},title = {{Dynamics of Climate Policy}},volume = {23},year = {2007}}@phdthesis{Fiddaman1997,abstract = {Assessing the economic and ecological impacts of climate change induced by human activity has become a major activity with a substantial modeling community. More than 20 climate-economy models have been developed to address different policy questions. While these integrated models are quite varied, most share some common assumptions and features. They typically employ a nested structure of neoclassical production functions to represent the energy-economy system. Technological potential is represented by elasticities of substitution, exogenous rates of technological improvement, and backstop energy prices. Factor allocation is myopically or intertemporally optimal. The impact of a carbon tax on the energy system at a given time can often be reduced to a simple tradeoff between abatement costs and emissions (though capital stock rigidities complicate the short- run picture in some models). The major endogenous dynamics of these models involve capital accumulation, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, and the temperature of the atmosphere and ocean system. These models draw heavily on the energy-economy models of the 70s and 80s, which were motivated by energy security issues and explored the potential impacts of increasing energy prices on economic growth. System dynamics models of that period shared the same motivation, but sought alternatives to the assumptions of optimization and equilibrium. They focused instead on disequilibrium dynamics and feedback complexity, with behavioral decision rules and explicit stocks and flows of capital, labor, and money. This research builds on earlier system dynamics models of energy economy interactions, creating a model that tests the implications of a number of feedback processes that have not been explored in the climate change context. Among these are endogenous technological change and boundedly rational decision making, with perception delays and biases. Energy requirements are embodied in capital, and energy production capacity depends on explicit capital stocks. The search for optimal The principal purpose of the model is to identify the structural features that have the greatest implications for policy, and thus are worthy of further pursuit. Experiments with the model indicate that depletion of oil and gas resources has critical interactions with climate policy. The inclusion of learning-by-doing and other path-dependent mechanisms suggests that abatement efforts will be more effective and should be more stringent than models with exogenous technology forecasts indicate. Inclusion of delays and biases from structural and behavioral features of the energy system creates higher long-run emissions reduction potential but imposes substantial constraints that prevent rapid reductions. Fair discounting and consideration of intangible damages substantially raise the indicated abatement effort. In both deterministic and uncertain cases, near-term inaction is a poor policy.},author = {Fiddaman, Thomas S},file = {:C$\backslash$:/Users/jtsalmi/AppData/Local/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Fiddaman et al. - 1997 - Feedback Complexity in Integrated Climate-Economy Models by.pdf:pdf},mendeley-groups = {Kandi,Kandi/Ilmasto},pages = {360},school = {Massachusetts Institute of Technology},title = {{Feedback Complexity in Integrated Climate-Economy Models by}},year = {1997}}@article{ElizabethR.SawinAndrewP.JonesTomFiddamanLoriS.SiegelDianaWrightTravisFranckAndreasBarkmanTomCummingsFelicitasvonPeterJacquelineMcGladeRobertW.Corell2009,abstract = {We report the creation and initial use of the Climate-Rapid Overview And Decision Support Simulator (C- ROADS) (1), a simple, fast, user-friendly simulation of climate change that conforms with accepted climate science while allowing decision makers to discover through interactive exploration the range of greenhouse gas emissions trajectories sufficient to achieve widely accepted goals for climate stabilization – such as stabilizing CO2 levels at or below 350–450 parts per million (ppm) or limiting temperature increase to no more than 2° Centigrade over pre-industrial temperatures.
